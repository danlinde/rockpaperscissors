rockpaperscissors
=================

This was my introduction to JavaScript at Makers Academy - Week 7.

The goal of this exercise was to take a simple rock-paper-scissors game in Ruby and translate it to JavaScript. Because, as much as possible, we used TDD at Makers, we also were asked to write specs in Jasmine.

Once I had the basic implementation finished, I extended the game to Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (as featured in Big Bang Theory).
